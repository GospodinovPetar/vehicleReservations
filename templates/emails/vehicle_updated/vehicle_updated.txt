Hi {{ user.get_full_name|default:user.username }},

A vehicle in your reservation {{ reservation.group.reference|default:("#" ~ reservation.group.pk) }} was edited.

Changed fields: {{ changed_fields|join:", " }}
Current details:
- Vehicle: {{ reservation.vehicle.name }}
- Pickup: {{ reservation.pickup_location.name }} | Return: {{ reservation.return_location.name }}
- Period: {{ reservation.start_date }} → {{ reservation.end_date }}

Because the reservation was previously RESERVED, its status has been set to PENDING for re‑review.

Thanks,
Support Team
